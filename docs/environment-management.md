# Environment Management Guide

This guide explains how to manage environment configurations in this project using the provided tools and following best practices.

## Environment Files

The project uses different environment files for different deployment contexts:

- `.env.example` - Template with all variables (committed to repository)
- `.env.development.example` - Development environment template (committed)
- `.env.test.example` - Test environment template (committed)
- `.env.production.example` - Production environment template (committed)
- `.env` - Active environment file (not committed, created by copying or linking)

## Setting Up Your Environment

1. Copy the appropriate example file to create your environment file:

   ```bash
   # For development
   cp .env.development.example .env.development
   
   # For testing
   cp .env.test.example .env.test
   
   # For production
   cp .env.production.example .env.production
   ```

2. Edit the copied file to set your specific values:

   ```bash
   # Edit with your favorite editor
   vim .env.development
   ```

3. Activate the environment you want to use:

   ```bash
   # Using the env_manager.py tool
   python tools/env_manager.py switch development
   ```

## Environment Manager Tool

The `env_manager.py` tool provides several commands to help manage your environment configurations:

### Switching Environments

```bash
# Switch to development environment
python tools/env_manager.py switch development

# Switch to test environment
python tools/env_manager.py switch test

# Switch to production environment
python tools/env_manager.py switch production
```

### Validating Environment Configuration

```bash
# Validate current environment
python tools/env_manager.py validate

# Validate specific environment
python tools/env_manager.py validate development
```

### Managing Backups

```bash
# Create a backup of the current environment
python tools/env_manager.py backup

# List all environment backups
python tools/env_manager.py list-backups

# Restore from a backup
python tools/env_manager.py restore .env.backup.20230101_120000
```

### Creating Templates

```bash
# Create a new .env.example template
python tools/env_manager.py create-template
```

## Best Practices

### Security

1. Never commit `.env` files with real credentials to version control
2. Use different credentials for each environment
3. Regularly rotate secrets, especially in production
4. Use environment variable encryption for highly sensitive data

### Environment Isolation

1. Use separate databases for each environment
2. Never connect development tools to production resources
3. Use different API keys for each environment
4. Implement network isolation between environments

### Validation

1. Always validate environment variables at application startup
2. Run environment-specific validation before deployment
3. Document all required variables and their acceptable values

### Automation

1. Use the provided tools to switch environments
2. Automate environment setup in CI/CD pipelines
3. Include environment validation in your build process

## Environment-Specific Guidelines

### Development Environment

- Enable debug mode for detailed error information
- Use verbose logging to aid in development
- Mock external services when possible to avoid costs
- Use local resources (database, cache, etc.)

### Test Environment

- Use isolated databases to prevent test interference
- Mock external services for deterministic tests
- Minimize logging to focus on test output
- Use in-memory or ephemeral resources when possible

### Production Environment

- Disable debug mode to prevent information leakage
- Use appropriate logging levels (warning/error)
- Implement proper security measures (SSL, firewalls, etc.)
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Use rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing environment variables**
   - Check if you've copied the correct example file
   - Validate your environment using the validation tool

2. **Environment switching issues**
   - Ensure the target environment file exists
   - Check for validation errors in the target environment

3. **Application startup failures**
   - Verify all required variables are set
   - Check environment-specific requirements (e.g., SSL in production)

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues with environment configuration:

1. Run the validation tool to identify problems
2. Check the application logs for specific error messages
3. Consult the project documentation for environment requirements

## Contributing Environment Changes

When making changes to environment configurations, follow these guidelines:

### Using Git Helpers

Always use the provided git helper functions for commits and PRs to ensure proper formatting and avoid issues with multi-line messages:

```bash
# Source the helper functions
source tools/git_helpers.sh

# Create a feature branch
create_feature_branch "update-env-config"

# Make your changes...

# Create a commit with a multi-line message
create_commit "Update environment configuration" "
- Added new required variables for feature X
- Updated validation rules for production
- Added documentation for new variables
"

# Push the branch
push_branch

# Create a PR
create_pr "Update environment configuration" "
## Changes
- Added new required variables for feature X
- Updated validation rules for production
- Added documentation for new variables

## Testing
- Validated in development and test environments
- Confirmed backward compatibility
"
```

### Checklist for Environment Changes

1. **Update All Environments**: When adding a new variable, update all environment example files
2. **Update Documentation**: Always update this document when making changes
3. **Update Validation**: Ensure the validation logic in `env_manager.py` is updated for new requirements
4. **Test All Environments**: Verify your changes work in all environments
5. **Review Security**: Ensure sensitive values are properly protected
